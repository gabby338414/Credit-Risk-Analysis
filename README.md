# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias and build and evaluate models using resampling. Then we used machine learning models to predict credit risk.
## Results: 
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
  * Ensemble Balance Random

  * Combination

## Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
My numbers for Ensemble Balance and AdaBoost recall and precision scores were the same. The prediction models for resampling (Smote, Naive, Undersampling, Combination) had different recall scores. But the precision score remained the same through the module.
